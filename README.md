# tic-tac-toe-game

This is a tic-tac-toe game that can be played in your IDE console! It is made using C# and .NET 7.0 (without top level statements).

You will need an IDE, like Visual Studio, in order to run this game.

Once in your IDE, run the Debug feature to start the game.

The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of C# and visual studio by building a IDE console game.
